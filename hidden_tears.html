			<h3 class="type-of-project">Photography Series of a Speculative Design Object</h3>



			<div class="project-description">

				<p><i>Hidden tears</i> was a speculative design and photography project for <i>Foundations of 4D</i> class at NYU Abu Dhabi. Almost one in five women lose a child in early pregnancy. Despite its frequency, miscarriage remains a taboo topic. “The Hidden Tears” helps women who have experienced miscarriage deal with their loss. Having developed maternal instincts in the short course of their pregnancy the object allows them to deploy these feelings by taking care of a baby. The baby is put into a secret pocket inside of a jacket, and it produces crying sounds, which can be terminated by putting a pacifier in its mouth. Because women very often do not share their loss, this object helps to deal with it privately, allowing them to proceed with their daily lives.</p>
