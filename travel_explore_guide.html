				<p><i>Travel Explore Guide</i> was a project for <i>Mashups: Creating with Web APIs</i> class at NYU Abu Dhabi. It is a website for traveling recommendations. The user inputs the name of the city and a category of interest.</p>

				<p>The user can choose from 11 categories - eating, hiking, sightseeing, going out, etc. I am using the Sygic Travel API and Open Weather API for acquiring data that is then displayed on the page.</p>

				<p class="title">After providing information and hitting <i>Search for Places</i>, suggestions and weather information appears</p>

				<p class="more-description">This project was exhibited in the end of the year Interactive Media Showcase at NYU Abu Dhabi in 2018. For the exhibition purposes, I asked for more input from the user â€“ his or her affiliation as well as home country. I am storing this information in the <i>IBM Cloudant database</i> as well as the city and activity that has been searched.</p>

				<p>The user can then explore all the cities that have been looked up as well as discover more details about the searches like how many people searched for a particular city, where they are from and what they were looking for.</p>
